## 📝 My Story

I’m a Data Analyst with 12 years of experience as a language trainer and academic coordinator, where I developed strong skills in analysing customer needs, simplifying ideas, and delivering tailored insights. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, I now translate complex data into actionable narratives.

Those who know me know I am dedicated to technology, pedagogy, and critical thinking. Discovering data storytelling has allowed me to integrate these areas into a meaningful career.

Thanks to my experience working for the British Council, I excel in collaborating with diverse international teams and engaging with a wide range of stakeholders. My mission is to harness the power of data to tell compelling stories that drive sustainable action.
