## 📝 My Story

I’m a Data Analyst with 12 years of experience as a language trainer and academic coordinator, where I developed strong skills in analysing customer needs, simplifying ideas, and delivering tailored insights. Using SQL, Python, and data visualisation tools like Power BI and Metabase, I now translate complex data into actionable narratives.

Those who know me know I am dedicated to technology, pedagogy, and critical thinking. Discovering data storytelling has allowed me to integrate these areas into a meaningful career, helping our teams at moka.care to make data-driven decisions that positively impact workplace mental health.
